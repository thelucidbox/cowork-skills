## IMPORTANT: Always Ask First

When the user says "ready to work", "get to work", or loads this folder:

1. **Greet and explain** what this skill does
2. **Ask what they need**:
   > "I can help you with [skill purpose]. Would you like to:
   > 1. **Start fresh** - I'll guide you through what I need
   > 2. **Use files in input/** - I'll process what you've added
   > 3. **See an example** - I'll show you what this produces"

3. **Never auto-run** without confirming what the user wants

### Why This Matters
Users loading a skill folder expect guidance, not assumptions. Always confirm before processing.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Natural Language
> "Organize my Downloads folder"

### Option 2: Deep Analysis
> "Excavate Downloads and find important files from the last year"

### Option 3: Cleanup Mode
> "Find duplicate and junk files in Downloads"

### Required
- **Access to Downloads**: Permission to analyze folder

### Optional (Enhances Output)
- **Time range**: Focus on specific period
