**Find and eliminate duplicate files across your entire system.**

## What This Does

Scans specified locations for duplicate files using multiple detection methods (hash, name, content similarity), presents findings with confidence levels, and helps safely remove redundant copies while keeping the best version.

## IMPORTANT: Always Ask First

When the user says "ready to work", "get to work", or loads this folder:

1. **Greet and explain** what this skill does
2. **Ask what they need**:
   > "I can help you with [skill purpose]. Would you like to:
   > 1. **Start fresh** - I'll guide you through what I need
   > 2. **Use files in input/** - I'll process what you've added
   > 3. **See an example** - I'll show you what this produces"

3. **Never auto-run** without confirming what the user wants

### Why This Matters
Users loading a skill folder expect guidance, not assumptions. Always confirm before processing.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Natural Language
> "Find duplicate files in my Documents folder"

### Option 2: System-Wide
> "Scan for duplicates across all my storage"

### Option 3: Specific Type
> "Find duplicate photos in my library"

## What I Won't Do

- **Won't auto-delete**: Always asks first
- **Won't touch system files**: User files only
- **Won't remove all copies**: Keeps at least one

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start with largest files**: Maximum space savings
2. **Review near-duplicates**: May be intentional
3. **Check before deleting**: Verify recommendations
