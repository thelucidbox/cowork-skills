**Extract insights from interactions to maintain relationship profiles and flag neglected connections.**

## What This Does

Analyzes your communications—emails, calendar, notes—to build and maintain relationship profiles. Tracks interaction frequency, surfaces insights about each person, and flags relationships that may need attention. Over time, accumulates knowledge to make every interaction more informed.

## IMPORTANT: Always Ask First

When the user says "ready to work", "get to work", or loads this folder:

1. **Greet and explain** what this skill does
2. **Ask what they need**:
   > "I can help you with [skill purpose]. Would you like to:
   > 1. **Start fresh** - I'll guide you through what I need
   > 2. **Use files in input/** - I'll process what you've added
   > 3. **See an example** - I'll show you what this produces"

3. **Never auto-run** without confirming what the user wants

### Why This Matters
Users loading a skill folder expect guidance, not assumptions. Always confirm before processing.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Natural Language
> "Check on my relationship with Sarah Chen"

### Option 2: Full Network
> "Run relationship pulse on my network"

### Option 3: Specific Check
> "Who haven't I talked to in 3 months?"

### Optional (Enhances Output)

## What I'll Pull Automatically

## Claude Artifacts (Interactive)

Ask Claude to create interactive artifacts you can use and return to:

| Artifact Type | What It Does | How to Request |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Relationship Dashboard** | Health overview of your network at a glance | "Create a relationship dashboard artifact" |
| **Contact Cards** | Interactive profiles with last contact and notes | "Build contact card artifacts" |
| **Outreach Tracker** | Track who to reconnect with and status | "Make an outreach tracker artifact" |
| **Network Map** | Visual map of your professional relationships | "Create a network map artifact" |

### Example Artifact Requests

**Relationship Health Dashboard**
> "Create a React dashboard showing: healthy contacts (green), needs attention (yellow), at risk (red) with counts and names"

**Contact Cards**
> "Build interactive contact cards with: name, last interaction, relationship strength, and quick notes"

**Reconnection Queue**
> "Create a tracker showing people I should reach out to, sorted by priority, with draft message status"

### Tips
- Review the dashboard weekly to catch relationships before they go cold
- Update contact cards after meaningful interactions
- Use the network map for strategic relationship planning

## Examples

### Example 1: Client Relationship Check
**Input**: "How's my relationship with Acme Corp contacts?"

**Output**:
- Profiles for each Acme contact
- Last interaction dates
- Health status: "Strong with Sarah, declining with Mike"
- Reconnection draft for Mike

### Example 2: Network Health Scan
**Input**: "Run relationship pulse"

**Output**:
- Dashboard: 45 active relationships tracked
- Healthy (contacted <30 days): 28
- Needs attention (30-90 days): 12
- At risk (>90 days): 5
- Reconnection drafts for at-risk relationships

### Example 3: Pre-Meeting Context
**Input**: "What do I know about James Wilson before our call?"

**Output**:
- Profile: Role, company, history with you
- Last 5 interactions summarized
- Topics discussed, preferences noted
- Conversation starters based on history

---

## What I Won't Do

- **Won't track without your data**: Only analyzes what you provide/connect
- **Won't contact people**: Drafts reconnection, you send
- **Won't share relationship data**: Profiles stay private
- **Won't judge relationships**: Reports status, you decide importance
- **Won't forget boundaries**: Respect professional/personal separation

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Tag VIP contacts**: I'll alert you sooner when they're neglected
2. **Add notes after interactions**: "Sarah mentioned new baby" enriches profiles
3. **Set frequency targets**: "Talk to investors monthly" creates useful alerts
4. **Review weekly**: Quick scan catches relationships before they go cold
5. **Include personal network**: Optional but valuable for holistic view

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Profile is thin"
More interactions = richer profile. Also try:
- Adding notes manually
- Connecting calendar for meeting history
- Reviewing email thread for insights

### "Missing people"
- Check email/contacts integration
- Add manually: "Add [name] to relationship tracking"
- They may not be in your digital trail

### "Wrong interaction dates"
Email dates may not match actual conversations (especially if discussed in person). Manually note: "Actually spoke with [name] on [date]."

### "Don't want to track everyone"
Specify: "Only track professional relationships" or "Exclude personal contacts"
