## Audience Tone Guidelines

### Executive
- Lead with conclusion
- Quantify when possible
- No preamble or context-setting
- Only include what requires their attention
- Max 100 words typical

### Team
- Context is valued—explain the why
- Be direct but not cold
- Include the human element
- Okay to show uncertainty
- Action items clear

### Client
- Always professional and warm
- Focus on value delivered
- Bad news: acknowledge + solution + timeline
- Never blame internal issues
- End with clear next steps

### Slack
- Scannable (bullets, bold)
- Casual but clear
- Emoji only if team culture supports
- Link to details vs. include everything

### Formal Email
- Complete and standalone
- Professional greeting and close
- All necessary context included
- Clear subject line

## Content Adaptation Rules

### What Changes Per Audience
| Element | Exec | Team | Client | Slack |
|---------|------|------|--------|-------|
| Length | Minimal | Full | Moderate | Brief |
| Technical detail | No | Yes | Depends | No |
| Internal challenges | Escalations only | Yes | No | Varies |
| Names/credit | Sometimes | Yes | No | Sometimes |
| Deadlines | If slipping | Yes | Commitments | Key dates |
| Next steps | Their action | All actions | Their action | Quick link |

### What Stays Constant
- Core facts (never change the truth)
- Timeline commitments made externally
- Critical blockers (adapted framing)
- Key decisions

---

## Sensitive Content Handling

### Auto-Exclude from Client/External
- Internal disagreements
- Resource/budget challenges
- Personnel issues
- Preliminary/uncertain information
- Technical debt discussions

### Flag for Review
- Bad news (ensure framing is appropriate)
- Commitments (ensure consistency)
- Legal/compliance mentions
- Anything marked confidential

### User Must Specify
- What's okay to share externally
- What needs exec approval first
- NDA-covered information

---

## Quality Checklist

Per Version:
- [ ] Core message preserved
- [ ] Tone appropriate for audience
- [ ] Length appropriate (exec short, team full)
- [ ] No internal-only content in external versions
- [ ] Action items clear for relevant audiences
- [ ] Can stand alone (doesn't require other versions)

Overall:
- [ ] All versions tell the same truth
- [ ] Sensitive content appropriately handled
- [ ] Nothing contradicts between versions
- [ ] Each audience gets what they need (no more, no less)

---

## Edge Cases

### Bad News Communication
- Exec: Brief + impact + mitigation
- Team: Full context + support they can provide
- Client: Proactive, solution-focused, maintain trust
- All: Same timeline commitment across versions

### Good News Communication
- Exec: Brief unless they'd want to share
- Team: Celebrate appropriately
- Client: Connect to value for them
- Consider who should hear first

### Partial Information
- Note uncertainty in all versions
- Don't commit to details still in flux
- "We're working on details" is valid
