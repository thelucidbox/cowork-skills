## Using the Outputs

### Review Process
1. Check each version for accuracy
2. Verify sensitive content handling
3. Adjust tone if needed
4. Confirm consistency across versions

### Sending Order (When Relevant)
Consider who should hear first:
1. Usually: Internal before external
2. Bad news: Exec heads-up, then team, then client
3. Good news: Whoever it's about first

### Customization
Edit outputs as needed—they're drafts, not final.
