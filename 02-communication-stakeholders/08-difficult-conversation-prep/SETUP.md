## Primarily Standalone

Difficult Conversation Prep works best through conversation. Most value comes from your input about the situation, not automated data.

---

## Optional: Email Integration

### What You'll Get
- Prior communication patterns with the person
- Tone and dynamic history
- Topics discussed before

### Setup (Gmail)
```
Settings → Integrations → Gmail → Connect
```

### Setup (Apple Mail)
```
System Settings → Privacy & Security → Mail → Enable
```

### Usage
> "Prep me for conversation with sarah@company.com—pull our email history"

---

## No Setup Required

### How It Works
Tell me about:
- Who you're talking to
- What the conversation is about
- What you want to achieve
- Any relevant history

### Why This Works
- You know nuances email doesn't capture
- Sensitive context shouldn't be in digital trail
- Fresh perspective can be valuable

---

## Verifying Setup

### Test Command
> "Test difficult conversation prep"

### Expected Result
```
✓ Ready for conversation preparation
✓ Email context: [Available/Not connected]
✓ Describe your situation to begin
```

---

## Privacy Considerations

### What Stays Private
- Your preparation documents are not stored
- Sensitive context stays in session
- No record of difficult conversations tracked

### Recommended Practice
- Don't include names in saved files if sensitive
- Delete prep documents after conversation
- Keep most sensitive prep in conversation only

## Input Files (Optional)

### For Additional Context
```
input/
├── prior-conversations.md    # Previous discussion notes
├── their-perspective.md      # What you know about their view
└── constraints.md            # What you can/can't offer
```

### For Recurring Relationship

```
