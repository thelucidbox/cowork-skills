3. **Request**: "I need a moment to collect my thoughts."

## Strategic Pause

- "This is important. Let's sleep on it and talk tomorrow."

## Abort Safely
- "I can see we're not going to resolve this today. Let's schedule a follow-up."
- "I value our relationship. Let's pause before we say things we regret."

## Preparation Principles

### Interest-Based Approach
- Focus on interests (why), not positions (what)
- Seek to understand their interests
- Find creative options that serve both

### Respect-First Framing

- Separate person from problem
- Preserve dignity

### Clarity Without Aggression
- Be direct but not attacking
- State your needs clearly
- Don't apologize for having needs

---

## Content Rules

### Always Include
- Their perspective (best-faith interpretation)
- Your BATNA (what you'll do if no agreement)
- De-escalation options
- Clear success criteria

### Always Exclude
- Personal attacks
- Manipulation tactics
- Win-at-all-costs framing
- Demands without rationale

### Flag for Reflection
- If your position seems unreasonable when written
- If you have no BATNA (consider developing one)
- If relationship damage is likely
