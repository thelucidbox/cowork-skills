## Analysis Guidelines

### Theme Identification
- Group semantically similar feedback
- Minimum 2 mentions to constitute theme
- Single mentions go to "Outliers"
- Don't force-fit feedback into themes

### Sentiment Classification
- **Positive**: Praise, satisfaction, appreciation
- **Negative**: Complaints, frustration, requests for change
- **Neutral**: Factual observations, suggestions without valence

### Signal vs. Noise
Strong signal:
- Multiple independent sources
- Specific, detailed feedback
- Consistent across time

Potential noise:
- Single mention
- Vague complaints
- Outliers from typical respondent profile

### Frequency vs. Importance
- High frequency + high importance = Priority 1
- Low frequency + high importance = Don't ignore (strategic)
- High frequency + low importance = Consider if easy
- Low frequency + low importance = Acknowledge only

---

## Quote Selection Rules

### Good Representative Quotes
- Clearly articulate the theme
- Specific rather than vague
- Capture sentiment accurately
- Diverse sources when possible

### Quote Attribution
- If feedback is attributed: Include source
- If anonymous: Use "[Anonymous]" or omit
- Never reveal anonymous sources

### Quote Editing
- Fix obvious typos: Okay
- Truncate with [...]: Okay
- Change meaning: Never
- Correct grammar: Only if necessary for clarity

---

## Response Draft Guidelines

### When to Draft Response
- Negative feedback from important source
- Direct question requiring answer
- Complaint needing acknowledgment
- Request for follow-up

### Response Tone
- Acknowledge the feedback
- Don't be defensive
- Commit to what you'll do
- Thank them for sharing

### Response Template
```markdown

**Their feedback**: [Brief summary]

---
