# Source Collector

**Gather, organize, and cite sources for research projects systematically.**

## What This Does

Collects sources from various inputs (URLs, PDFs, notes), extracts key information, generates proper citations, and creates organized research bibliographies with annotations and relevance ratings.

| Output | What You Get |
|--------|--------------|
| sources/ | Collected materials |
| bibliography.md | Formatted citations |
| source-notes.md | Annotated summaries |

## IMPORTANT: Always Ask First

When the user says "ready to work", "get to work", or loads this folder:

1. **Greet and explain** what this skill does
2. **Ask what they need**:
   > "I can help you with [skill purpose]. Would you like to:
   > 1. **Start fresh** - I'll guide you through what I need
   > 2. **Use files in input/** - I'll process what you've added
   > 3. **See an example** - I'll show you what this produces"

3. **Never auto-run** without confirming what the user wants

### Why This Matters
Users loading a skill folder expect guidance, not assumptions. Always confirm before processing.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Natural Language
> "Collect and organize my sources on climate change"

### Option 2: From URLs
> "Add these articles to my research sources"

### Option 3: Build Bibliography
> "Create a bibliography from my collected sources"

## Claude Artifacts (Interactive)

Ask Claude to create interactive artifacts you can use and return to:

| Artifact Type | What It Does | How to Request |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Source Library** | Browse and search all collected sources | "Create a source library artifact" |
| **Citation Generator** | Quick copy citations in different formats | "Build a citation generator artifact" |
| **Reading Tracker** | Track which sources you've read and noted | "Make a reading tracker artifact" |
| **Source Cards** | Key info from each source at a glance | "Create source card artifacts" |

### Example Artifact Requests

**Source Library Dashboard**
> "Create a React artifact showing all my sources: filterable by type (article/book/other), searchable, with quick access to citations"

**Citation Copier**
> "Build an artifact where I can select a source and copy its citation in APA, MLA, or Chicago format"

**Reading Progress**
> "Create a tracker showing sources with status: Not Read, Reading, Read, Noted—with progress stats"

### Tips
- Add sources as you find them to build your library over time
- Use the citation generator when writing to maintain consistency
- The reading tracker ensures you don't miss important sources

- APA citations generated
- Annotated bibliography
- Relevance rankings

### Example 2: Literature Review
**Input**: Academic sources on topic

**Output**:

## What I Won't Do

- **Won't fabricate sources**: Real sources only
- **Won't plagiarize**: Proper attribution always
- **Won't access paywalled content**: Public info only

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Provide DOIs when available**: Best metadata
2. **Specify citation style early**: Consistent formatting
3. **Add notes as you go**: Better annotations
