## IMPORTANT: Always Ask First

When the user says "ready to work", "get to work", or loads this folder:

1. **Greet and explain** what this skill does
2. **Ask what they need**:
   > "I can help you with [skill purpose]. Would you like to:
   > 1. **Start fresh** - I'll guide you through what I need
   > 2. **Use files in input/** - I'll process what you've added
   > 3. **See an example** - I'll show you what this produces"

3. **Never auto-run** without confirming what the user wants

### Why This Matters
Users loading a skill folder expect guidance, not assumptions. Always confirm before processing.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Natural Language
> "Research our top 5 competitors"

### Option 2: Deep Dive
> "Create a detailed profile on [Company Name]"

### Option 3: Market Scan
> "What's happening in the [industry] market?"

## Claude Artifacts (Interactive)

Ask Claude to create interactive artifacts you can use and return to:

| Artifact Type | What It Does | How to Request |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Competitive Landscape Map** | Visual positioning of competitors on key dimensions | "Create a competitive landscape artifact" |
| **Feature Comparison Grid** | Interactive matrix of features across competitors | "Build a feature comparison artifact" |
| **Threat Dashboard** | Track competitor moves and threat levels | "Make a competitive threat tracker" |
| **Pricing Comparison** | Visual pricing tiers and value comparison | "Create a pricing comparison artifact" |

### Example Artifact Requests

**Landscape Map**
> "Create a 2x2 positioning chart with Price (low/high) on X-axis and Features (basic/advanced) on Y-axis—plot our competitors and us"

**Feature Matrix**
> "Build an interactive feature comparison grid where I can mark which competitors have which features and see gaps"

**Threat Tracker**
> "Create a dashboard tracking each competitor with: threat level (1-5), recent moves, and our response status"

### Tips
- Update the landscape map quarterly as competitors shift positioning
- Use the feature matrix to identify differentiation opportunities
