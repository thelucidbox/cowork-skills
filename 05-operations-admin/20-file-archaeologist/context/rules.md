### Rename Logic
1. Extract date from metadata or content

3. Apply naming convention
4. Preserve extension

### Duplicate Detection
- Compare file hashes
- Compare size + date
- Note which is "original" (older)

## Safety Rules

### Never Delete
- Files modified in last 7 days
- Files with "keep" or "important" in name
- Files in protected locations
- When in doubt

### Ask Before
- Deleting duplicates
- Removing old files
- Changing file structure

---
