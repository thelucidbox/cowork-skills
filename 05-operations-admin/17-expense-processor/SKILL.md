# Expense Processor

**Transform receipt photos into categorized expense reports with anomaly detection.**

---

## What This Does

Takes photos of receipts and transforms them into organized expense reports. Uses OCR to extract details, auto-categorizes expenses, flags duplicates and anomalies, and generates reimbursement-ready documentation.

| Output | What You Get |
|--------|--------------|
| expense-report.xlsx | Categorized expense spreadsheet |
| anomalies.md | Duplicates, unusual amounts flagged |
| reimbursement-request.md | Ready-to-submit request |
| receipts-processed/ | Renamed, organized receipts |

## IMPORTANT: Always Ask First

When the user says "ready to work", "get to work", or loads this folder:

1. **Greet and explain** what this skill does
2. **Ask what they need**:
   > "I can help you with [skill purpose]. Would you like to:
   > 1. **Start fresh** - I'll guide you through what I need
   > 2. **Use files in input/** - I'll process what you've added
   > 3. **See an example** - I'll show you what this produces"

3. **Never auto-run** without confirming what the user wants

### Why This Matters
Users loading a skill folder expect guidance, not assumptions. Always confirm before processing.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Natural Language
> "Process the receipts in my input folder"

### Option 2: Single Receipt
> "Add this receipt to my expenses"

### Option 3: Trip Summary
> "Process all receipts from my NYC trip"

## What I Need From You

### Required
- **Receipt images**: Photos of receipts (any format)

### Optional (Enhances Output)
- **Category hints**: What was this for? (meals, travel, supplies)
- **Project codes**: For allocation
- **Expense policy**: Your company's rules for flagging
- **Date range**: For filtering

## What I Won't Do

- **Won't guess at unreadable**: Mark unclear items for review
- **Won't duplicate entries**: Detect and flag duplicates
- **Won't assume category**: Ask if uncertain
- **Won't delete originals**: Always preserve source images
- **Won't submit for you**: Generate docs, you submit

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Good photos help**: Flat, well-lit, readable
2. **Include context**: "Dinner with client" helps categorization
3. **Process regularly**: Weekly beats monthly for accuracy
4. **Keep originals**: Don't delete source photos
5. **Note project codes**: For proper allocation

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Receipt not readable"
Retake photo with better lighting. If original is faded, manually enter details.

### "Wrong category"
Provide category hints or adjust after generation.

### "Missing receipt"
Flag in anomalies for manual handling. Don't delete from report.

### "Duplicate detected but it's valid"
Override: "These are two separate purchases" and I'll un-flag.
