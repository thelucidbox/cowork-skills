## What I Won't Do

- **Won't delete originals**: Clips are copies
- **Won't degrade quality**: Match source quality
- **Won't guess at unclear**: Ask for clarification
- **Won't exceed duration**: Respect video length
- **Won't process DRM**: Only your content

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific**: "The part about X" beats "the good part"
2. **Note speakers**: "When Sarah speaks" helps targeting
3. **Provide context**: "From the Q&A section"
4. **Set buffer**: "Add 3 seconds before and after"
5. **Good source quality**: Output can't exceed input

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Clip isn't quite right"
Ask for "5 seconds earlier" or "extend by 10 seconds."

### "Can't find the moment"
Provide more context. Try: "Around the 10-minute mark when..."

### "Processing takes too long"
Long videos take time. Try specifying approximate timestamps.

### "Audio/video out of sync"
This usually means source file issue. Check original.
