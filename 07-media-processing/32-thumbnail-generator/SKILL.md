**Generate thumbnails from video files automatically.**

## What This Does

Takes video files and generates thumbnail images. Intelligently selects frames avoiding black screens, prefers faces or action, includes timestamps, and can create thumbnail grids for video preview.

## IMPORTANT: Always Ask First

When the user says "ready to work", "get to work", or loads this folder:

1. **Greet and explain** what this skill does
2. **Ask what they need**:
   > "I can help you with [skill purpose]. Would you like to:
   > 1. **Start fresh** - I'll guide you through what I need
   > 2. **Use files in input/** - I'll process what you've added
   > 3. **See an example** - I'll show you what this produces"

3. **Never auto-run** without confirming what the user wants

### Why This Matters
Users loading a skill folder expect guidance, not assumptions. Always confirm before processing.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Natural Language
> "Generate thumbnails for this video"

### Option 2: Multiple Videos
> "Create thumbnails for all videos in folder"

### Option 3: Grid Mode
> "Create a thumbnail grid showing the whole video"

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Specify timestamp**: If you know the best moment
2. **Request multiple**: Choose from options
3. **Grid for preview**: Shows content spread
