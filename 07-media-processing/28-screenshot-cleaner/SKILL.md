# Screenshot Cleaner

**OCR screenshots, rename by content, organize by topic, and create searchable index.**

---

## What This Does

Takes a folder of screenshots and transforms chaos into organized, searchable archive. Uses OCR to read text content, renames files descriptively, groups by topic, removes duplicates, and creates a searchable index.

| Output | What You Get |
|--------|--------------|
| organized-screenshots/ | Renamed and organized |
| duplicates-removed.md | What was deduplicated |
| index.md | Searchable index |

---

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Natural Language
> "Organize my screenshots"

### Option 2: Specific Folder
> "Clean up screenshots in ~/Desktop/Screenshots"

### Option 3: Search Mode
> "Find all screenshots about project X"

---

### Required
- **Screenshots**: Folder of screenshot images

### Optional (Enhances Output)

## What I'll Pull Automatically

## What I Won't Do

- **Won't delete without permission**: Move to duplicates folder
- **Won't lose data**: Preserve dates, keep originals available
- **Won't misclassify**: Ask about uncertain items
- **Won't expose sensitive**: Flag and handle carefully
- **Won't over-organize**: Simple structure preferred

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Process regularly**: Weekly beats monthly cleanup
2. **Note sensitive content**: Will handle appropriately
3. **Define categories**: "Work, personal, reference"
4. **Keep duplicates folder**: Review before deleting
5. **Update index**: As you add new screenshots

---

## Troubleshooting

### "OCR isn't reading content"
Some images don't have text. Will categorize by visual content or ask.

### "Wrong categories"
Specify your categories and criteria.

### "False positive duplicates"
Similar screenshots marked. Review duplicates list.

### "Missing screenshots"
Check duplicates folder. Nothing is deleted automatically.
