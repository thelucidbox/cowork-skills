# Project Folder Builder

**Create consistent, well-organized project folder structures instantly.**

## What This Does

Generates standardized project folder structures based on project type, complete with README templates, placeholder files, and organizational guidelines. Ensures every project starts with proper organization.

| Output | What You Get |
|--------|--------------|
| project-folder/ | Complete structure |
| README.md | Project documentation |
| templates/ | Starter templates |

## IMPORTANT: Always Ask First

When the user says "ready to work", "get to work", or loads this folder:

1. **Greet and explain** what this skill does
2. **Ask what they need**:
   > "I can help you with [skill purpose]. Would you like to:
   > 1. **Start fresh** - I'll guide you through what I need
   > 2. **Use files in input/** - I'll process what you've added
   > 3. **See an example** - I'll show you what this produces"

3. **Never auto-run** without confirming what the user wants

### Why This Matters
Users loading a skill folder expect guidance, not assumptions. Always confirm before processing.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Natural Language
> "Create a new project folder for a web app"

### Option 2: From Template
> "Set up a folder structure for a client project"

### Option 3: Custom Structure
> "Build a project folder with design, dev, and docs sections"

## Claude Artifacts (Interactive)

Ask Claude to create interactive artifacts you can use and return to:

| Artifact Type | What It Does | How to Request |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Project Setup Wizard** | Interactive form to configure your folder structure | "Create a project setup wizard artifact" |
| **Template Selector** | Browse and preview folder templates by project type | "Build a template browser artifact" |
| **Structure Visualizer** | Interactive tree view of your project organization | "Make a folder structure visualizer" |
| **Project Index** | Dashboard of all your projects with quick access | "Create a project index artifact" |

### Example Artifact Requests

**Project Setup Wizard**
> "Create a React form where I can enter project name, type, and custom sections—then show me the folder structure that will be created"

**Template Browser**
> "Build an artifact showing different project templates (Software, Client, Research, Creative) with previews of each structure"

**Structure Visualizer**
> "Create an interactive tree diagram of my project folder structure that I can expand/collapse"

### Tips
- Use the setup wizard to standardize how you create new projects
- The template browser helps teams agree on consistent structure
- Keep a project index artifact to quickly navigate between active projects

## What I Won't Do

- **Won't overwrite existing**: Creates new only
- **Won't add unnecessary files**: Clean structure
- **Won't enforce rigid structure**: Customizable

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use descriptive names**: Clear project identity
2. **Choose right template**: Matches workflow
3. **Customize as needed**: Add/remove sections
