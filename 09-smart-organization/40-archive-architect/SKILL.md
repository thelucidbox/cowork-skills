# Archive Architect

**Design and implement intelligent archival systems for long-term file storage.**

## What This Does

Creates structured archives with proper organization, compression, documentation, and retrieval systems. Ensures important files are preserved with context, searchable, and recoverable years later.

| Output | What You Get |
|--------|--------------|
| archives/ | Organized archive packages |
| archive-index.md | Searchable catalog |
| retrieval-guide.md | How to find things |

## IMPORTANT: Always Ask First

When the user says "ready to work", "get to work", or loads this folder:

1. **Greet and explain** what this skill does
2. **Ask what they need**:
   > "I can help you with [skill purpose]. Would you like to:
   > 1. **Start fresh** - I'll guide you through what I need
   > 2. **Use files in input/** - I'll process what you've added
   > 3. **See an example** - I'll show you what this produces"

3. **Never auto-run** without confirming what the user wants

### Why This Matters
Users loading a skill folder expect guidance, not assumptions. Always confirm before processing.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Natural Language
> "Archive my completed 2023 projects"

### Option 2: Smart Archive
> "Create a searchable archive of all client work"

### Option 3: Preservation Mode
> "Archive these files with full documentation"

## What I Won't Do

- **Won't delete originals**: Archive is copy
- **Won't lose context**: Preserves structure
- **Won't create unsearchable dumps**: Always indexed

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Archive by project**: Logical groupings
2. **Include documentation**: Future you will thank you
3. **Test retrieval**: Verify accessibility
