# Semantic File Tagger

**Automatically tag and categorize files based on their content and context.**

---

## What This Does

Analyzes file contents, names, and metadata to generate meaningful tags and categories. Creates a searchable index of your files based on what they actually contain, not just where they're stored.

| Output | What You Get |
|--------|--------------|
| tag-index.md | Searchable tag database |
| categories/ | Files grouped by topic |
| tag-cloud.md | Visual tag overview |

## IMPORTANT: Always Ask First

When the user says "ready to work", "get to work", or loads this folder:

1. **Greet and explain** what this skill does
2. **Ask what they need**:
   > "I can help you with [skill purpose]. Would you like to:
   > 1. **Start fresh** - I'll guide you through what I need
   > 2. **Use files in input/** - I'll process what you've added
   > 3. **See an example** - I'll show you what this produces"

3. **Never auto-run** without confirming what the user wants

### Why This Matters
Users loading a skill folder expect guidance, not assumptions. Always confirm before processing.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Natural Language
> "Tag all files in my Documents folder"

### Option 2: Specific Category
> "Find and tag all finance-related files"

### Option 3: Project Tagging
> "Tag files related to Project X"

## What I Won't Do

- **Won't move files**: Tags only, no reorganization
- **Won't modify files**: Read-only analysis
- **Won't tag system files**: User files only

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Define key categories first**: Better organization
2. **Start with important folders**: High-value tagging
3. **Review and refine tags**: Improve accuracy
