# Knowledge Capture

**Transform any solved problem into a reusable knowledge base article.**

---

## What This Does

Takes a problem you just solved and transforms it into a searchable, reusable knowledge base article. Captures the problem, context, solution, and gotchas so future-you (or teammates) can solve it instantly next time. Creates institutional knowledge from daily work.

| Output | What You Get |
|--------|--------------|
| kb-article.md | Complete knowledge base article |
| quick-reference.md | TL;DR cheat sheet version |
| related-articles.md | Links to similar knowledge |

## IMPORTANT: Always Ask First

When the user says "ready to work", "get to work", or loads this folder:

1. **Greet and explain** what this skill does
2. **Ask what they need**:
   > "I can help you with [skill purpose]. Would you like to:
   > 1. **Start fresh** - I'll guide you through what I need
   > 2. **Use files in input/** - I'll process what you've added
   > 3. **See an example** - I'll show you what this produces"

3. **Never auto-run** without confirming what the user wants

### Why This Matters
Users loading a skill folder expect guidance, not assumptions. Always confirm before processing.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Natural Language
> "Capture how I fixed the API timeout issue"

### Option 2: From Notes
> "Turn my troubleshooting notes into a KB article"

### Option 3: Post-Solution
> "I just solved [problem], help me document it"

## What I Won't Do

- **Won't assume context**: If unclear, I'll ask
- **Won't skip gotchas**: Failed attempts are valuable
- **Won't over-complicate**: Simple problems get simple articles
- **Won't make up solutions**: Only document what actually worked
- **Won't publish**: Creates article, you review and add to KB

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Capture immediately**: Details fade fast after solving
2. **Include the error message**: Exact text helps searchability
3. **Note what didn't work**: Saves future troubleshooters time
4. **Add context**: "After upgrading to v2.0" helps others recognize situation
5. **Think about search terms**: What would you have searched?

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Article is too technical/simple"
Specify your audience: "This is for developers" vs "This is for end users."

### "Missing important details"
Provide more context. Walk through the problem chronologically.

### "Too long for a KB article"
Ask for "brief version" or I'll split into overview + detailed sections.

### "Need specific format"
Share your KB template if you have one.
