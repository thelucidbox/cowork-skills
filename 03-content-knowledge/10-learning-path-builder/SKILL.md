# Learning Path Builder

**Generate a structured curriculum from any skill goal—phases, resources, and first assignment ready.**

---

## What This Does

Takes a skill you want to learn and builds a complete learning path. Breaks the skill into phases, finds resources matched to your level, mixes learning formats (video, reading, practice), and gives you your first assignment immediately. Prefers free resources but includes paid options where they're significantly better.

| Output | What You Get |
|--------|--------------|
| learning-path.md | Complete curriculum with phases and milestones |
| resources.md | Curated list of tutorials, courses, books |
| first-assignment.md | Start today—immediate practical task |
| progress-tracker.md | Track your advancement |

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Natural Language
> "Build me a learning path for Python programming"

### Option 2: With Context
> "I want to learn machine learning. I know Python basics. I have 5 hours per week."

### Option 3: Specific Goal
> "Help me learn enough SQL to analyze our sales data"

## What I Need From You

### Required
- **Skill goal**: What do you want to learn?

### Optional (Enhances Output)
- **Current level**: What do you already know?
- **Time available**: Hours per week you can dedicate
- **Learning style**: Video vs reading vs hands-on
- **End goal**: Why are you learning this?
- **Timeline**: Any deadline?

## Examples

### Example 1: Programming Language
**Input**: "Learn Python, complete beginner, 3 hours/week"

**Output**:
- Phase 1: Basics (variables, loops) - 2 weeks
- Phase 2: Functions and data structures - 2 weeks
- Phase 3: Working with files - 1 week
- Phase 4: First project - 2 weeks
- Resources: Free interactive tutorials, one recommended paid course
- First assignment: Install Python, write "Hello World"

### Example 2: Professional Skill
**Input**: "Get better at public speaking"

- Phase 2: Delivery (voice, body language) - 3 weeks
- Phase 3: Audience engagement - 2 weeks
- Phase 4: Advanced (Q&A, improvisation) - 2 weeks
- Resources: Books, YouTube channels, local Toastmasters
- First assignment: Record yourself for 2 minutes on camera

### Example 3: Tool Mastery
**Input**: "Learn Figma for UI design, know Sketch already"

**Output**:
- Phase 1: Interface and key differences from Sketch - 1 week
- Phase 2: Components and variants - 1 week
- Phase 3: Prototyping and collaboration - 1 week
- Phase 4: Advanced features (auto-layout, plugins) - 2 weeks
- Resources: Official tutorials, YouTube comparisons
- First assignment: Rebuild an existing Sketch file in Figma

## What I Won't Do

- **Won't create content**: Curate existing resources, not create courses
- **Won't guarantee timeline**: Estimates based on typical learners
- **Won't skip fundamentals**: Build on solid foundations
- **Won't ignore your level**: Adapt difficulty to where you are
- **Won't only list paid options**: Free resources prioritized

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific about goal**: "Python for data analysis" beats just "Python"
2. **Share constraints**: Budget, time, preferred formats all help
3. **Mention learning style**: "I learn best by doing" shapes the path
4. **Include end goal**: "To get a job" vs "for personal projects" matters
5. **Be honest about level**: Starting at wrong level wastes time

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Path is too long/ambitious"
Specify time constraint: "I need functional skills in 4 weeks" and I'll prioritize ruthlessly.

### "Resources are outdated"
Ask for current search: "Find 2024 resources for [topic]"

### "Too many/few resources"
Specify: "Give me just the top 3" or "I want lots of options to explore"

### "First assignment is too easy/hard"
Tell me your actual level more specifically. The assignment should stretch but not overwhelm.
