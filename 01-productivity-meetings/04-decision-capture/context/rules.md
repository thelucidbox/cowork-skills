## Analysis Guidelines

### Criteria Selection
Include at minimum:
- Cost / Resource impact
- Time / Speed to outcome
- Quality / Effectiveness
- Risk / Uncertainty
- Reversibility / Flexibility

Add context-specific:
- Stakeholder alignment
- Strategic fit
- Team capability
- Scalability
- Maintenance burden

### Scoring Rules
- 1: Poor / Does not meet
- 2: Below average / Partially meets
- 3: Average / Adequately meets
- 4: Above average / Exceeds
- 5: Excellent / Far exceeds

### Weight Guidelines
- 5: Must-have, deal-breaker importance
- 4: Very important, significant factor
- 3: Important, meaningful consideration
- 2: Nice-to-have, secondary factor
- 1: Minor, tie-breaker only

---

## Assumption Surfacing

### Questions to Uncover Assumptions
- "What would need to be true for Option X to work?"
- "What are we taking for granted?"
- "What if [stakeholder] has different priorities than stated?"
- "What external factors could change?"

### Common Hidden Assumptions
- Market conditions will stay stable
- Team has necessary skills
- Timeline is realistic
- Budget won't change
- Stakeholder support will continue
- Technology will perform as expected

---

## Recommendation Rules

### Confidence Levels
- **High**: Clear winner, robust across assumptions
- **Medium**: Best option but sensitive to assumptions
- **Low**: Close call, recommend pilot/test

### When NOT to Recommend
- Options are genuinely equivalent
- Critical information is missing
- Decision owner needs to apply values not captured

### Dissent Requirement
Always include "why someone might choose differently" — validates that trade-offs are acknowledged.
