# Prep Kit Generator — Input Folder

## What Goes Here

Add context files to enhance your meeting prep.

### Useful Inputs

| File Type | What It Adds |
|-----------|--------------|
| Previous meeting notes | Continuity and follow-up items |
| Email threads | Conversation context |
| Company research | Additional background |
| Your goals document | Shapes talking points |

### File Naming

Descriptive names help automatic processing:
- `previous-meeting-2024-01-10.md` ✓
- `email-thread-acme-proposal.txt` ✓
- `my-goals-for-meeting.md` ✓

## Tips

1. **Prior debrief outputs work perfectly**: Drop in `future-brief.md` from previous meetings
2. **Email context helps**: Copy-paste important email exchanges
3. **State your goals clearly**: A simple "I want to close this deal" shapes everything
4. **Include concerns**: "I'm worried about their timeline" generates relevant talking points

## Without Input Files

The skill works fine without input files using:
- Calendar event details
- Web research on attendees
- Information you provide in conversation
