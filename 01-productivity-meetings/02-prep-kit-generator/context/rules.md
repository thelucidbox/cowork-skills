- Recent company announcements

### What NOT to Research
- Personal life beyond professional
- Salary or financial information
- Private social media
- Speculation about intentions

### Source Priority
1. LinkedIn (most reliable for professional)
2. Company website (official context)
3. News articles (recent developments)
4. Professional content they've created

### When Information is Unavailable
- State "Not found" rather than guessing
- Note what was searched
- Suggest alternative approaches

- Your meeting history with them if available
- At least 3 talking points
- Questions to ask (discovery focus)

### Always Exclude
