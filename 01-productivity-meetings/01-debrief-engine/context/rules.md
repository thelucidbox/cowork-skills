## Tone Guidelines

### Team Tone
- Use first names
- Contractions okay ("we'll" not "we will")
- Casual openers ("Hey team," "Quick recap:")
- Emoji sparingly if team culture supports it

### Client Tone
- Full names on first reference
- Formal but warm
- Professional openers ("Thank you for your time today")
- No emoji unless client uses them first

### Executive Tone
- Lead with outcome/decision
- No pleasantries—straight to point
- Bullet points preferred
- Flag blockers prominently

---

## Content Rules

### Always Include
- Every decision mentioned, even tentative ones
- All action items with best-effort owner assignment
- Questions that were raised but not answered
- Next meeting or follow-up timing if mentioned

### Always Exclude
- Side conversations marked as off-record
- Personal comments not relevant to outcomes
- Speculation about attendees' motivations
- Information marked as confidential for specific outputs

### Flag for Review
- Decisions without clear rationale
- Actions without owners
- Deadlines that seem unrealistic
- Potential conflicts between decisions

---

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing outputs, verify:

- [ ] Every decision has context (not just "we decided X")
- [ ] Every action has an owner (or explicitly flagged as unassigned)
- [ ] Deadlines are specific dates, not "soon" or "later"
- [ ] Follow-up emails don't include internal-only information
- [ ] Open loops have suggested next steps
- [ ] Future brief captures relationship/preference insights
- [ ] No PII in outputs unless necessary
- [ ] Tone matches requested style

---

## Edge Case Handling

### Conflicting Information in Notes
- Note both versions
- Flag as "Needs clarification"
- Don't guess at resolution

### Missing Attendee Information
- Use names exactly as they appear in notes
- Mark email addresses as "[email TBD]"
- Suggest completing info before sending

### Vague Decisions
- Capture as written
- Add to open loops: "Decision X needs specificity"
- Don't invent details

### No Clear Decisions Made
- State "No formal decisions recorded"
- Focus action tracker on discussed next steps
- Note if meeting may have been exploratory
