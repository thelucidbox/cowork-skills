# Executive Summary Email Template

## Structure

```
Subject: [Topic]: Key Outcomes

[Name],

**Bottom Line:** [One sentence: what was decided/outcome]

**Key Decisions:**
- [Decision 1]
- [Decision 2]

**Actions Underway:**
- [Critical action + owner]

**Blockers/Escalations:** [None / specific blocker needing attention]

**Next Update:** [Date/milestone]

[Brief sign-off]
```

## Tone Notes

- Lead with the answer
- No preamble or pleasantries
- Bullets over prose
- Flag blockers prominently — don't bury
- Assume they'll read in 30 seconds

## Length Target

50-150 words. Maximum 200 words.

## Structure Rules

1. Bottom line first — always
2. Only include decisions that matter at exec level
3. Actions: only those with exec visibility/impact
4. Blockers: be direct about what needs help
5. Next update: set expectation

## Customization Points

- `[Topic]`: Brief identifier they'll recognize
- `[Name]`: First name typically fine for execs you report to
- `[Brief sign-off]`: Can omit entirely, or just "—[Your name]"

## What to Escalate

- Budget decisions above threshold
- Timeline risks
- Resource conflicts
- External dependencies at risk
- Decisions needing exec approval

## What NOT to Include

- How you got to the decision
- Who disagreed
- Low-level action items
- Context they already have
