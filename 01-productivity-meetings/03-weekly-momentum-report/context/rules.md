## Analysis Guidelines

### Identifying Wins
Look for:
- Completed tasks (explicit "done" or "finished")
- Decisions made
- Meetings that moved things forward
- Problems solved
- Learning completed
- Positive feedback received

Don't overlook:
- Small completions that compound
- Maintained habits
- Things prevented (avoided problems)
- Difficult conversations had

### Identifying Blockers
Look for:
- Repeated mentions of same issue
- "Stuck on" or "waiting for" language
- Items mentioned but no progress noted
- Frustration indicators
- Multi-day gaps in topic

Categorize by:
- Dependency (waiting on others)
- Clarity (need more information)
- Skill (need to learn something)
- Resource (need time/tools/access)
- Priority (competing demands)

### Detecting Patterns
Minimum data needed:
- Single week: Snapshots only
- 3+ weeks: Pattern detection possible
- 8+ weeks: Trend analysis reliable

Patterns to surface:
- Time of day productivity
- Meeting impact on focus
- Communication load correlation
- Energy patterns
- Recurring blockers

---

## Content Rules

### Always Include
- At least 2 wins (dig if necessary)
- All identified blockers with next moves
- Specific priorities for next week
- Energy insights if data available

### Always Exclude
- Judgment about productivity
- Comparison to others
- Unrealistic expectations
- Vague recommendations

### Tone Guidelines
- Honest but not harsh
- Celebrate wins genuinely
- Present blockers as solvable
- Recommendations actionable

---

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Wins feel accurate (not inflated)
- [ ] Blockers have specific next moves
- [ ] Patterns supported by evidence
- [ ] Priorities are achievable (not wish list)
- [ ] Energy analysis is constructive
- [ ] Report is actionable, not just descriptive

---

## Edge Cases

### Light Week (Few Notes)
- Note data limitation
- Ask about context
- Focus on what is available
- Don't pad with generic content

### Heavy Week (Overwhelming Notes)
- Summarize ruthlessly
- Highlight top 3-5 wins
- Prioritize blockers by impact
- Note volume in report

### Vacation/PTO Week
- Acknowledge reduced work
- Focus on before/after momentum
- Note intentional rest as win
