## Note Format

No specific format required. These all work:

**Bullet style:**
```
- Had call with Sarah
- Finished the proposal
- Stuck on API integration
```

**Prose style:**
```
Productive morning. Got the proposal done finally.
Afternoon was rough - couldn't figure out the API issue.
```

**Task list style:**
```
[x] Proposal
[x] Team standup
[ ] API integration (blocked)
```

## Tips

1. **Include everything**: More data = better analysis
2. **Don't clean up**: Raw notes work fine
3. **Add goals doc**: Makes wins more meaningful
4. **Include previous report**: Enables pattern tracking
5. **Note energy casually**: Even "good day" / "tired" helps
