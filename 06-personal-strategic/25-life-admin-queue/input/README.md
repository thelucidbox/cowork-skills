# Life Admin Queue — Input Folder

## What Goes Here

Admin task lists and configuration.

### Structure

```
input/
├── admin-dump.md         # Brain dump of tasks
└── admin-config.md       # Availability/preferences
```

---

## Brain Dump Format

Any format works:

```markdown
# Admin Tasks

- Call dentist
- Renew car registration
- Deal with that insurance thing
- Update address somewhere?
- Cancel Netflix or Hulu (one of them)
- Taxes???
- Schedule vet appointment
```

Vague is fine—I'll make it concrete.

Just brain dump in conversation:
