**Compile a year's accomplishments into self-review and brag doc ready for performance reviews.**

## What This Does

Scans your year's calendar, email, notes, and completed work to compile comprehensive accomplishments. Generates a self-review draft, brag document, and metrics summary. Captures wins you've forgotten and praise you've received.

## What I Won't Do

- **Won't fabricate accomplishments**: Only surface what happened
- **Won't inflate metrics**: Honest quantification only
- **Won't exaggerate**: Accurate representation of impact
- **Won't include confidential info**: You control what's shared
- **Won't write fiction**: Real accomplishments, your words

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Save praise year-round**: Forward kudos to a folder
2. **Note completions**: Quick log when projects ship
3. **Track metrics**: Numbers are powerful in reviews
4. **Include stretch work**: Projects beyond your role
5. **Run before needed**: Prep takes time, don't rush

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing accomplishments"
Scan email sent folder for project completions. Check calendar for milestones.

### "Hard to quantify impact"
Look for: time saved, revenue influenced, people helped, errors prevented.

### "Format doesn't match our template"
Provide your company's template and I'll match it.

### "Too many/few items"
Specify: "Focus on top 10 accomplishments" or "Include everything."
