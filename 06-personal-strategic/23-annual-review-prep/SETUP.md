## Verifying Setup

## Best Practice: Year-Round Tracking

### Monthly 5-Minute Update
```

└── accomplishments-log.md
```

```markdown
## January 2024
- Shipped [project]
- Led [initiative]
- Received kudos from [person]

## February 2024
...
```

This makes annual compilation trivial.

## Review Template

If your company has a specific format:
```
input/
└── review-template.md
```

Outputs will match your template structure.
