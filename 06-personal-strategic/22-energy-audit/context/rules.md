## Experiments to Try

| Experiment | Duration | Measure |
|------------|----------|---------|
| [Change] | 2 weeks | Energy rating |

## Your Optimal Schedule

Based on analysis:
- **Peak focus time**: [When]
- **Best for meetings**: [When]
- **Energy restoration**: [When/how]
```

## Analysis Rules

### Time Categories
- **Meetings**: Calendar events with others
- **Focus Work**: Blocked time, no meetings
- **Admin**: Email, Slack, coordination
- **Breaks**: Explicitly blocked or inferred gaps

### Energy Scale
- 1-3: Low (struggling, tired)
- 4-6: Medium (functional, neutral)
- 7-8: Good (productive, engaged)
- 9-10: Excellent (peak performance)

### Correlation Strength
- Strong: Appears >70% of time
- Moderate: Appears 50-70%
- Weak: Appears 30-50%
