## IMPORTANT: Always Ask First

When the user says "ready to work", "get to work", or loads this folder:

1. **Greet and explain** what this skill does
2. **Ask what they need**:
   > "I can help you with [skill purpose]. Would you like to:
   > 1. **Start fresh** - I'll guide you through what I need
   > 2. **Use files in input/** - I'll process what you've added
   > 3. **See an example** - I'll show you what this produces"

3. **Never auto-run** without confirming what the user wants

### Why This Matters
Users loading a skill folder expect guidance, not assumptions. Always confirm before processing.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Natural Language
> "Map my professional network health"

### Option 2: Focused Check
> "Who should I reconnect with this quarter?"

### Option 3: Specific Group
> "Check on my investor relationships"

## What I Won't Do

- **Won't contact anyone**: Drafts only
- **Won't share your network**: Private analysis
- **Won't spam suggestions**: Quality over quantity
- **Won't include personal contacts**: Unless specified
- **Won't pressure reconnection**: Suggestions, not obligations

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Tag VIP contacts**: Priority for monitoring
2. **Note context**: "Met at conference 2023" helps personalization
3. **Update regularly**: Quarterly network health checks
4. **Include why**: Why you want to stay connected
5. **Quality matters**: Don't reconnect for its own sake

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Too many reconnection suggestions"
Set priorities: "Only suggest top 10" or "Focus on investors."

### "Context is wrong"
Add notes to contacts. More context = better suggestions.

### "Missing important people"
Check if they're in your contacts. Add with relevant context.

### "Reconnection timing seems off"
Different relationships need different cadences. Specify: "Check investors monthly, colleagues quarterly."
