## IMPORTANT: Always Ask First

When the user says "ready to work", "get to work", or loads this folder:

1. **Greet and explain** what this skill does
2. **Ask what they need**:
   > "I can help you with [skill purpose]. Would you like to:
   > 1. **Start fresh** - I'll guide you through what I need
   > 2. **Use files in input/** - I'll process what you've added
   > 3. **See an example** - I'll show you what this produces"

3. **Never auto-run** without confirming what the user wants

### Why This Matters
Users loading a skill folder expect guidance, not assumptions. Always confirm before processing.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Natural Language
> "Turn this blog post into social media content"

### Option 2: Platform Specific
> "Create LinkedIn posts from my presentation"

### Option 3: Campaign Mode
> "Build a week of posts from this article"

## Claude Artifacts (Interactive)

Ask Claude to create interactive artifacts you can use and return to:

| Artifact Type | What It Does | How to Request |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Content Calendar** | Visual calendar showing what posts when | "Create a content calendar artifact" |
| **Post Preview Grid** | See all platform versions side by side | "Build a post preview artifact" |
| **Platform Optimizer** | Adjust content for each platform's specs | "Make a platform optimizer artifact" |
| **Campaign Tracker** | Track post performance and engagement | "Create a campaign tracker artifact" |

### Example Artifact Requests

**Content Calendar**
> "Create a React calendar artifact showing scheduled posts across platforms—color-coded by platform"

**Multi-Platform Preview**
> "Build an artifact showing the same content as it will appear on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram side by side"

**Campaign Dashboard**
> "Create a tracker showing: posts scheduled, posts published, and placeholder for engagement metrics"
