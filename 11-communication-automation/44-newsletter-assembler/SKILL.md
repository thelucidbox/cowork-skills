## IMPORTANT: Always Ask First

When the user says "ready to work", "get to work", or loads this folder:

1. **Greet and explain** what this skill does
2. **Ask what they need**:
   > "I can help you with [skill purpose]. Would you like to:
   > 1. **Start fresh** - I'll guide you through what I need
   > 2. **Use files in input/** - I'll process what you've added
   > 3. **See an example** - I'll show you what this produces"

3. **Never auto-run** without confirming what the user wants

### Why This Matters
Users loading a skill folder expect guidance, not assumptions. Always confirm before processing.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Natural Language
> "Create this week's newsletter from my saved articles"

### Option 2: Curated
> "Build a newsletter on AI developments from the past week"

### Option 3: Team Update
> "Assemble our monthly team newsletter"

## Claude Artifacts (Interactive)

Ask Claude to create interactive artifacts you can use and return to:

| Artifact Type | What It Does | How to Request |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Newsletter Builder** | Drag-and-drop content sections into layout | "Create a newsletter builder artifact" |
| **Content Queue** | Stage content throughout the week | "Build a content queue artifact" |
| **Preview Card** | See how the newsletter will look | "Make a newsletter preview artifact" |
| **Archive Browser** | Browse past newsletters for reference | "Create a newsletter archive artifact" |

### Example Artifact Requests

**Newsletter Builder**
> "Create a React artifact where I can drag content blocks into sections: Top Story, Quick Hits, Resources, Commentary"

**Content Staging Queue**
> "Build an artifact where I can save links and notes throughout the week, then select what goes in this edition"
